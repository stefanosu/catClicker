This Project was very useful in learning and implementing JavaScript Design Patterns. In this cat clicker app I'm using The Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern specifies that an application consist of a data model, presentation information, and control information. The pattern requires that each of these be separated into different objects. ... MVC mostly relates to the UI / interaction layer of an application. 

Learning and implementing design patterns are very important when building an application because it helps you write well architectured efficient code that maximizes the UI experience.
